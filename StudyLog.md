Selected topic for my next article

Wowâ€¦ that's a huge hole that needs filled. 
I've been doing a deep dive into software different methodologies and noticed that there is a huge problem with software documentation actually being updated and one of the most popular software development methodologies is one of the worst at keeping software documentation updated. How to fix that?
Am I just going to create my own system? That would be an insanely bold move. Am I even ready to do that? Fine, I've never worked on a single software development team, I've never even been an executive at a company, but I've used software and been at the receiving end of terrible documentation. I can study for what software methodologies need. I have a degree in Business Management. I am excellent at finding solutions to complex problems that many feel is impossible. I literally created a scientifically based study you could use to prove or disprove, the existence of God and had 3 college professors review it to confirm it would be an authentic and valid study if completed. So, why not. This is the problem that massive rabbit hole I've been diving down took me to find. That is what I am going to solve. Time to start putting my newfound belief in myself to the test, and then stretched to its limits. Current problem is approximately 77% of software documentation is out of date. 
Let's get my brain going. 
End goal, a software development methodology that had as realistically close to 100% updated documentation. 
Needs
The methodology needs to catch bugs
Encourage creativity
Keep teams organized
Allow for adaptability
Scalability and enterprise readiness
Integration with modern technologies and practices
Efficiency, measurable, and sustainability
Easy adoption
Likely need to automate the documentation process
