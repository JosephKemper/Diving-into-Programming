## Chapter 1
I got no further than the first sentence in the preface before I had to stop and ask a question. The quote that struck me so hard was "The gap between the best software engineering practice and the average practice is very wide, perhaps wider than in any other engineering discipline. A tool that disseminates good practice would be important." Fred Brooks 
Which left me to ask "If AI is trained from community knowledge, and the average practice in software engineering is of such low quality, is AI being trained to be a low-quality programmer?" From there, I got to thinking that if all you have to offer is something produced by an AI, why should a company hire you instead of just turning to that same AI?
Don't get me wrong, I definitely see the advantages of AI, and believe that anyone who does not use AI will eventually be left behind. But I also believe that if all you do is us AI to churn out everything with little to no thought or effort on your part, then there is nothing stopping you from being replaced by that same AI you are using as a crutch. 
From there, the other thing that stood out was just how many non-coding related activities there are in software development.
