## Chapter 1
I got no further than the first sentence in the preface before I had to stop and ask a question. The quote that struck me so hard was "The gap between the best software engineering practice and the average practice is very wide, perhaps wider than in any other engineering discipline. A tool that disseminates good practice would be important." Fred Brooks 
Which left me to ask "If AI is trained from community knowledge, and the average practice in software engineering is of such low quality, is AI being trained to be a low-quality programmer?" From there, I got to thinking that if all you have to offer is something produced by an AI, why should a company hire you instead of just turning to that same AI?
Don't get me wrong, I definitely see the advantages of AI, and believe that anyone who does not use AI will eventually be left behind. But I also believe that if all you do is us AI to churn out everything with little to no thought or effort on your part, then there is nothing stopping you from being replaced by that same AI you are using as a crutch. 
From there, the other thing that stood out was just how many non-coding related activities there are in software development. 

According to the author, I am not sure I qualify as the target audience for Code complete. I don't care. 
I want to learn how to think like a programmer, and I set a goal to become a master programmer, and for me that will involve a deep dive into studying programming to figure out how programmers think â€¦ or maybe it might be better to say how I want to think as a programmer. Given the gap between the best practices and the common practices of programming, and the likelihood of that gap widening as result of AI and especially vibe coding, learning how I should think as a software engineer, will be critical in achieving my goal. And with how my brain thrives off of knowledge, diving in as deeply as I am planning, even into a book I might not be ready to dive into, is going to be a good thing. 

If I had to take a guess, based on just how hard it is to learn good practices (based on what Code Complete says) then I would bet that once I finish learning things like software architecture in a few books, I will likely start to see patterns for how everything ties together. And if I don't automatically find those patterns, then I am certain I will find them when I go back for the 3rd run through all of the books. I feel good about this journey. It is going to fill in a lot of gaps for me. 

From my prior experience on places like stack overflow (which admittedly is limited) it seems that programmers are terrible at sharing things online, and when you do get places dedicated towards the idea, it seems to become so full of arrogance that you cannot even ask a simple question, and when you do meet their unrealistic standards for even being able to ask a question, you find people completely ignoring the question you ask, and answering something else entirely, and even voting down an answer that shares a direct answer to the question being asked. 
And while that is only one community, the lack of any other book as comprehensive as Code Complete, and the lack of any one viable place to go online especially as a beginner, says to me there is a gap in the software development industry, and while (assuming my limited experience in places like StackOverflow) it might ruffle a few feathers, maybe those feathers need to be ruffled a bit. 

As I was composing my list of questions to dive deeper into the topics covered in the preface and chapter 1 of Code Complete, I kept having one question pop into my mind. At first I wanted to find a nicer way of wording the question, but then I just realized I already know the answer. The question (worded bluntly) is "Why do so many companies create environments where taking shortcuts on quality is not only acceptable, but almost forced?" And really the answer is the same thing that causes problems I have with the stock market, too many people are too short sighted for their own good and that nature because of the difference between software engineering and other types of more physical engineering. For example, if I build a piece of buggy code then I can just release a patch for it later. But, if I build a poorly designed bridge then people are going to die. One of the things I had to stop and research into when going through the chapter the first time, was to discover what went into those coding projects where only 30% of the time was spent coding verses those projects where 80% was spent coding, and the difference ended up being that for those industries where people's lives are at risk, they take fewer shortcuts, and spend more time making sure they got things right. So, essentially, when they don't have to, people, like the electricity that powers the computers they write code on, take the path of least resistance. 

Questions to ponder and/or research
Why do so many areas of coding end up so often neglected?
What are the habits of new programmers that lead them to success compared to the habits of those who fail and leave the industry?
What habits do I need to develop if I am to become a master software engineer?
What habits do I need to break and drop like a bad habit if I am to become a master software engineer?

From an industry perspective, what knowledge/skills are required to thrive in the following areas of software construction: 
Problem definition
Requirements Development
Construction planning
Software architecture or high-level design
Detailed design
Coding and debugging
Unit testing
Integration testing
Integration
System testing
Corrective maintenance

Also, are there any other areas of software development that might have developed over the last 2 decades since Code Complete was last updated?
How do I create a culture where shortcuts are frowned upon as a matter of habit? Would that really be the best path, or would there be a happy medium somewhere in the middle? Or are things truly better as they currently are? From the race between Microsoft and Apple, the company who got things out first won. Microsoft won the Operating system wars despite (based on the perspective of Steve Jobs) having an inferior and buggier product. First is not always the winner. Sometimes they just open the door for someone else later. 
I guess another area connected with this is consumer expectation. For example, my poetry, even when fed hundreds of my poems, from my perspective, an AI is incapable of replicating my style. But from the perspective of someone who cares far less about a product, an AI might be able to easily replicate my style and even surpass it. If I am to create a culture of mastery, what all do I need to change? It sounds like consumer expectations might be part of what I would need to change as well. Then again, maybe I just don't have enough information. All good questions to ponder.
