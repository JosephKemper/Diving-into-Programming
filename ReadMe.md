I need and highly benifit from a deeper level of knowledge than is ever presented in a classroom setting. I also recognize that programming is a deepy and wonderfully complex topic. Accordingly, I am giving myself permisison to take my time in learning programming, and will dive in as deep as I need. I have 7 programming books, and the lessons on FreeCodeCamp. I am going to go through all of them, and will log my learning journey here.
