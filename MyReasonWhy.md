If you just learned the vocabulary to a second language and never learned the grammar or other nuances of the language, do you think that you could ever write a book in that language? What if it were an emotionally intense mystery thriller of a novel? What if you had never written a book in the first place? Do you think you could ever write a book in a language when the only thing you knew about it was its vocabulary? 

Just like writing a novel requires more than vocabulary, programming requires more than just syntax. To truly excel at programming, you need to master a wide range of skills. Just asking an AI I got the following list:

1. Problem-Solving and Critical Thinking
2. Algorithm and Data Structure Mastery
3. Version Control Proficiency
4. Software Design and Architecture
5. Debugging and Troubleshooting
6. Testing and Quality Assurance
7. System Operations and DevOps
8. Adaptability to New Technologies
9. Understanding of Software Development Lifecycle
10. Understanding of the industry you are building software for

When you step beyond the syntax of whatever language you are using to write your program in, and start to truly master the nuances of programming, you start to step into a world where you're creating solutions, driving innovation, and shaping the future. 

I know the syntax of programming. Because they touched so little on things beyond syntax the 5 computer programming classes in college I took left me feeling so ill prepared to become a programmer, that I have had to figure out on my own what I was missing.  Right now, I'm learning everything else, I chose a series of the most recommended programming books to study from, and when I'm finished, I am going to compile it into my own book Thinking Like a Programmer, the book I would have wanted to have when I was first wanting to become a programmer fresh out of high school. 

I've got 9 books to read (minimum), and a ton of practicing to do before I'm ready to write my book. But, I'm looking forward to the challenge, the agony, the frustration, of pulling principles needed for success, from an industry that seems to be terrible at sharing them, and turning them into the book I would want to read, if I wanted to learn to think like a programmer. 

I believe that when you learn to think like a programmer, you step into a world of true fulfillment and joy, a world filled with thrilling challenges that morph every day into something new and exciting, a world where you get to collaborate with people who find it thrilling to solve the next puzzle placed before you, and all while constantly choosing to raise the bar for yourself and those around you of what is possible in software development. 

I want to become a master programmer, and I believe the only way to truly master a topic is to teach others. So, I am going to teach others what I need most, how to think like a programmer, and in the process, raise the bar for programming education. What have you seen that sets the best programmers apart? Let's start a conversation and push this industry forward together.

I'm redoing my plan to include the process of writing a bunch of articles to let me reqularly put out high quality articles which will likely be turned into videos afterwards, as I am reading. So instead of just taking notes and compiling everything at the end, I am going to dive into topics as I go, and create high quality conent throughout my journey to write a book.
