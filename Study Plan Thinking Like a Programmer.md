# Comprehensive Study Plan for "Thinking Like a Programmer"

This study plan is designed to align your reading of the source books with the outline of your book, "Thinking Like a Programmer." It emphasizes depth, long-term thinking, and integration of concepts to foster mastery. The plan is structured sequentially by the parts and chapters in your book's outline, suggesting relevant chapters from the source books to read *before* or *during* writing each chapter of your book. This allows you to synthesize ideas while applying the Guiding Principles: stay a learner by questioning assumptions, seek failure through experimentation (e.g., code exercises from the readings), obliterate comfort zones with advanced topics, work intentionally by taking notes and refactoring examples, and master through teaching by incorporating explanations in your writing.

For each section, I've estimated a time frame assuming 10-20 hours per week (adjust based on your pace), including reading, coding exercises, and reflection. Read the suggested chapters in full, even if only parts directly apply, to build comprehensive understanding. Use Python where possible, as it aligns with several books (e.g., Fluent Python, Problem Solving with Algorithms).

After covering all aligned readings, an **Additional Readings** section groups the remaining chapters from the source books into thematic clusters for post-outline study. These can inform appendices, future volumes, or personal growth.
