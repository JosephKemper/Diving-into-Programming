## Study Plan
Read the following list of books
1. Code Complete 2nd edition by McConnell 
2. Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs by Ableson and Jay
3. Software Architecture: The Hard Parts: Modern Trade-Off Analyses for Distributed Architectures by Ford, Richards, Sadalage, and Dehghani
4. The Pragmatic Programmer by Thomas and Hunt 
5. Clean Code by Martin 
6. Refactoring by Fowler 
7. Problem Solving with Algorithms and data structures using Python by Miller and Ranum
8. Design Patterns Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software by Gamma, Helm, Johnson, and Vlissides 
9. Fluent Python by Ramalho 

For each book I will use the following strategy for studying. 
1. I will read a chapter just diving in trying to take in as much as I can, specifically trying to take in as much as I can. 
2. After that first reading of the chapter, I will write down thoughts I had about what I read, any questions I have, and possible insights. 
3. Next, I will reread the same chapter, looking for deeper insights, and taking notes on what I find. 
4. From there, compose my notes writing up a more formal summary of what I learned, and sharing what I learned online. 
5. As I read the chapter the second time, I will actively look for ways to apply what I am learning. For example, if I am learning about a binary search tree, I will try to build a binary search tree computer program. 
6. Then, I will repeat that process with the next chapter and continue until I have read every book on my list following
7. After Finishing reading each book following that prior process, I will read through each book again, specifically looking for things I want to include in the book I will be writing, along with pulling from things I have previously written. 

## Study Plan Revision Notes
Two weeks ago, I was so paralyzed by the idea of trying to figure out how to plan something I had never done, that I was ready to quit. I chose instead to learn more. In the two weeks since I started my learning journey, I learned a simple and powerful way to plan something I had never done. I also learned (unsurprisingly) that the real problem I was facing was that I was simply overcomplicating things. I also learned that when trying to make plans, you don't have to have all the answers, you simply need to make the best guess you can, with the information you have, and then move forward. My goal is to become a master programmer. I have a measurable standard to determine how to tell when I have gotten there. But in order to get there, especially in an industry like software development, I will need to become a lifelong learner who constantly puts out high quality content relating to the field I am trying to master. 
Up until now, I have just been reading, taking notes with the intention of using those notes to publish a book, and sharing them online. Yesterday, while reading I did not dive into it as much as I otherwise would have. And while those days are going to happen and are just a natural part of life, it did get me thinking and even praying, because I did not want those once in a while days to happen too often, and being strategic about how you approach things is the way to mastery. From there, I found myself remembering about something I heard Jordan Peterson say. Specifically telling us that the reason you have to write things in college is because the process of writing and the process of thinking is exactly the same in the brain. Thus, if you learn to write better about a given topic, you learn to think better on a given topic. From there, with that added bit of information, I modified my plans for mastering programming. I am still going to publish my book, I am just going to publish a ton more high quality content between now and then. I will read with the intention of finding a problem to solve, even if that problem is just I want to learn more about it. From there, I apply the Problem-Solving Pyramid to the problem in question, figure out what a possible solution to it might look like, create basic plan of how I can get there, and then write a paper to discuss what I learned. I will write this at the college level, and will publish it at least on LinkedIn, and likely share it on other sites as well. From there, I will repeat my new learning habit 6 days a week (no Sundays) for the rest of my life.
