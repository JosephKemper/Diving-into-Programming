## Study Plan
Read the following list of books
1. Code Complete 2nd edition by McConnell 
2. Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs by Ableson and Jay
3. Software Architecture: The Hard Parts: Modern Trade-Off Analyses for Distributed Architectures by Ford, Richards, Sadalage, and Dehghani
4. The Pragmatic Programmer by Thomas and Hunt 
5. Clean Code by Martin 
6. Refactoring by Fowler 
7. Problem Solving with Algorithms and data structures using Python by Miller and Ranum
8. Design Patterns Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software by Gamma, Helm, Johnson, and Vlissides 
9. Fluent Python by Ramalho 

For each book I will use the following strategy for studying. 
1. I will read a chapter just diving in trying to take in as much as I can, specifically trying to take in as much as I can. 
2. After that first reading of the chapter, I will write down thoughts I had about what I read, any questions I have, and possible insights. 
3. Next, I will reread the same chapter, looking for deeper insights, and taking notes on what I find. 
4. From there, compose my notes writing up a more formal summary of what I learned, and sharing what I learned online. 
5. As I read the chapter the second time, I will actively look for ways to apply what I am learning. For example, if I am learning about a binary search tree, I will try to build a binary search tree computer program. 
6. Then, I will repeat that process with the next chapter and continue until I have read every book on my list following
7. After Finishing reading each book following that prior process, I will read through each book again, specifically looking for things I want to include in the book I will be writing, along with pulling from things I have previously written.
